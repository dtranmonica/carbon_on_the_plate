# carbon_on_the_plate
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical testing of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in the food supply chain using Python, Pandas, and Scipy.

# Project overview
Data has been collected from Kaggle.com then be processed and visualised with Python and its libraries. The analysis aims to examine food production with significant or marginal carbon footprint then analyse stages in agri-food supply chain and its contribution to the total GHG emissions. 

# Business questions
Stage 1: Total Emissions rankings
- Which are the lowest-emitting food products?
- Which are the highest-emitting food products? 
Stage 2: Agro-chain structural analysis
- What are the most dominant stages in creating GHG emissions?
- Which stages contribute the least GHG emissions?
Stage 3: Agri-chain correlation analysis
- What is the ratio between the upstream and downstream phases?
